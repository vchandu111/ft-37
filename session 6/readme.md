Git vs Github

Github => an internet solution to store code for developers

Login form => username and password => functionality => stored on Github => version 1
version 2 => concentrated on ui => issue with functionality => 2000 lines of code => not able to figure out the issue
diff version 1 and version 2 => compare changes only => easy to debug
go back to version 1 => Reverting

Features of Git =>

1. Version Control => Keeps track of changes to codebase, collaborate with other devs
2. Distributed => Distributed version control => copy of codebase with its own history for all devs
3. Branching and Merging =>
4. Committing => Creating new version with every commit
5. Remote repositories =>
6. Merge Conflicts =>

intro.js => Arnab =>
Shivam => some changes =>
var x = '123'

x => in different expressions

var x = function(){}
to call something => create some objects

Merge conflict => Rsolve the conflicts before merge

Parent codebase => main/master branch => dashboard page => Logo with some banners => error free or bugfree

<!--  initialize a readme => master/main -->

Sohban => copy1 => Login page => Own branch => 1. prevents errors in parent codebase, 2. Develop work individually without merge to parent codebase
Pritam => copy2 => Products page => Own branch
Kuldeep => copy3 => Payment page => Own branch

Clone => downloading/ making a copy of repository present on Github onto vs code

Stage and Commit => add, commit
git add <filename> or git add . => Staging => collects all files which have to be a part of the new system

git commit -m "Meaningful commit message" => Commit => Creating the new version

Push => git push origin <brnachname> => upload to github

<!-- Code, upload it to Github
Uploading to Github => Stage and Commit
Push
 -->

<!-- Project =>
Details to project
 -->

Repository => Folder => Project Folder

git revert <commitCode>
<!-- 4dc2dc1512b3cd40cf9bd239be419013a94112f7 -->
